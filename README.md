# CSS Random Tests

These repository contains an HTML page showing some information about the CSS
features supported by your Web browser.

I've made this page to dicover wich CSS fetures was available on my ebbok
reader, but it should works on any device with a Web browser ...

You can access the test page at:

copy/study/modify/improve what you want :-)
